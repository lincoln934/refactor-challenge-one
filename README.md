## Ticket Description

### Client described project as follwos:


AS A marketing agency.
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards.
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards.
WHEN I view the source code.
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements.
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
WHEN I view the image elements.
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.
WHEN I view the heading attributes.
THEN they fall in sequential order.
WHEN I view the title element.
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
